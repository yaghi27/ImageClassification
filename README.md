## ML Programming Project

1. Object recognition with CIFAR10
    The goal is to create a model that recognize and classify 10 type of different objects provided by the dataset the end goal is to be able to upload an image to the model and the model will return the type

2. Approach
    First we want to load the data split it, then after preprocessing train the model on it. After that we will test it to see if the accuracy is what we intended and acceptable on the testing data if no we will have to reprocess the data and train again

3. Dataset: CIFAR10

#### Ethics Statement and Data Use
1. Data Source:
This project utilizes the CIFAR-10 dataset, which is publicly available and widely used in machine learning research. CIFAR-10 was created and distributed by the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR) and contains 60,000 labeled images across 10 classes, designed for benchmarking image classification algorithms.

2. Compliance with Terms of Use:
We have adhered to the dataset's terms of use, including any licensing agreements and restrictions. The dataset was accessed from its original and authorized source to ensure compliance with its intended purpose for academic and research applications.

3. Ethical Considerations:
The CIFAR-10 dataset does not include sensitive or personally identifiable information, as it consists of generic images. We confirm that no modifications were made to the dataset that could alter its ethical implications, and all experiments conducted using this dataset were carried out in accordance with established research standards.

4. Acknowledgment:
We acknowledge and thank the CIFAR team for providing this valuable resource, which has significantly contributed to the advancement of machine learning research.
